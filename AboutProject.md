The attached inpynb file contains a ML model which helps us predict the Handwritten Digits

The model uses MNIST dataset for this model.
MNIST: The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

This model uses Python Language and many of its Libraries like:
1) pandas
2) numpy
3) matplotlib
4) tensorflow
5) sklearn
6) keras library of tensorflow


The model uses ANN(Artifictial Neural Network)
Artificial neural networks are a branch of machine learning models that are built using principles of neuronal organization discovered by connectionism in the biological neural networks constituting animal brains.

This model has an Accuracy Metrics of **86.15%**
